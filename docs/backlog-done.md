# Backlog: done

Rows finished, moved from [backlog.md](backlog.md), newest last.

- Core library and the native check: ManagedCodecs + FastYuv against the FFmpeg path
  - Why: exactness first; before any UI, the scene and stats CSVs must equal ShotDetector's FFmpeg path's.
  - Status: Done (2026-10-24: every sample, all five detectors and all together, byte for byte; tools/NativeCheck)

- WebAssembly check, interpreted and AOT
  - Why: the same results on browser-wasm, and nothing of FFmpeg on the path.
  - Status: Done (2026-10-24: tools/WasmCheck under Node; FFmpeg.AutoGen never loaded interpreted, never loaded by
    the runs under AOT)

- Repository and CI
  - Why: the showcase lives in its own repository with its own CI (shotdetector's decision 2026-10-24).
  - Status: Done (2026-10-24: handed off from shotdetector's `handoff/shotdetector-web` branch; the first CI run on
    `main` green, 9m41s)

- Packages from nuget.org
  - Why: ShotDetector and ShotDetector.FastYuv 3.14.0 are on nuget.org (released 2026-10-24), so the local feed was a
    workaround for a problem that is gone.
  - Status: Done (2026-10-24: the local-feed source, CI's packing step and SHOTDETECTOR_REF dropped; a restore into
    an empty global packages folder takes both from nuget.org)

- The app project: one browser-wasm project with the page's exports, replacing WasmCheck
  - Why: the page needs a browser-wasm project with `[JSExport]`; one project means the exactness check runs the
    page's own entry points (decision "One wasm project").
  - Status: Done (2026-10-24: `src/ShotDetectorWeb.App` with `Open`, `Detect`, `LoadedAssemblies` and `progress`,
    `wwwroot/worker.js`; `tools/app-check.mjs` under Node, 108 of 108 CSVs identical interpreted and AOT; FastYuv's
    `.wasm` and license checked in the publish output; tools/WasmCheck deleted)
